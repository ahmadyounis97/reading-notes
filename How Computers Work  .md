#  How Computers Work
* starting with what makes a computer a computer? 

Then, you'll look at how information is represented inside the computer
using tiny electrical signals going on and off at mind-boggling speeds.
After that, you'll learn how computers use circuits to do everything
from simple math to simulating entire virtual worlds

# What does make a computer a computer anyway And how does it even work?
 we've always built tools to help us solve problems.
Tools like a wheelbarrow, a hammer, or a printing press, or a tractor-trailer.
All of these inventions helped us with manual work.

* It would need to take input,
* store information
* process it 
* and then output the results.


**(but these four things are common to all computers.
That's what makes a computer a computer.)**

### First, we're going to talk simply how the computer work 

> about input is the stuff that the world does or
that you do that makes the computer do stuff.
You can tell computers what to do
with the keyboard,

> All these different inputs give a computer
information, which is then stored in memory

> A computer's processor takes
information from memory It manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm, which is just a series of commands.
And then it sends the processed information back to be stored in memory ag

> This continues until the processed information is ready to be output.
