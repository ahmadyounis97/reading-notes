#  How Computers Work
* starting with what makes a computer a computer? 

Then, you'll look at how information is represented inside the computer
using tiny electrical signals going on and off at mind-boggling speeds.
After that, you'll learn how computers use circuits to do everything
from simple math to simulating entire virtual worlds

### What does make a computer a computer anyway And how does it even work?
 we've always built tools to help us solve problems.
Tools like a wheelbarrow, a hammer, or a printing press, or a tractor-trailer.
All of these inventions helped us with manual work.

* It would need to take input,
* store information
* process it 
* and then output the results.


**(but these four things are common to all computers.
That's what makes a computer a computer.)**

### First, we're going to talk simply how the computer work 

> about input is the stuff that the world does or
that you do that makes the computer do stuff.
You can tell computers what to do
with the keyboard,

> All these different inputs give a computer
information, which is then stored in memory

> A computer's processor takes
information from memory It manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm, which is just a series of commands.
And then it sends the processed information back to be stored in memory ag

> This continues until the processed information is ready to be output.

### How do you store or represent information using electricity?
if you have a single wire with electricity flowing through it,
the signal could either be on or off.
That's not a lot of choices, but it's a really
important start.
With one wire, we can represent a yes or no,
true or false,
a one or zero,
or anything else with only two options.
This on/off state of a single wire is called a bit,
and it's the smallest piece of information a computer can store.
(**each position in a number has a different value.**)

For example 900, a 9 in the 100 position is a 900.
In binary, each position also carries
a value.
But instead of multiplying by 10 each time, we multiply by 2

(When you use a computer to write code or make your own app,
you're not dealing directly with these ones and zeros.
But you will be dealing with images or sound or video.
So if you want to understand how computers work on the inside,
it all comes down these simple ones and zeros
and the electrical signals in the circuits behind them.
They are the backbone of how all computers input, store, process, and output information.)

### How Computers Work: Circuits and Logic? 

Every input or output of a computer is effectively a type of information,
which can be represented by on or off electrical signals
or ones and zeros.
In order to process the information that comes in as input, and to make the information that is output,
a computer needs to modify and combine the input signals.
To do this, a computer uses millions of teeny electronic components, which come together to form circuits.


For example, you can make a circuit that adds 2 bits together called an adder.
This circuit takes in 2 individual bits, each one a 1 or a 0, and adds them together to calculate the sum.
The sum can be 0 plus 0 equals 0,
0 plus 1 equals 1, or 1 plus 1 equals 2.
You need two wires coming out because it can take up to two binary digits to represent the sum.
Once you have a single adder for adding two bits of information,
you can put together multiples of these adder circuits side-by-side to add together much larger numbers.
For example, here's how an 8-bit adder adds the numbers 25 and 50.
Each number is represented using 8 bits, resulting in 16 different electrical signals that go into the circuit.

### How Computers Work: CPU, Memory, Input & Output? 

Let's talk about input first.
Computers can take many different types of input, like the keyboard of a computer, the touchpad of a phone,
a camera, a microphone, or a GPS.


When you press a key on your keyboard - let's say the letter "B". The keyboard converts the letter to a number.
That number is sent as binary, ones and zeros, into the computer.
Starting from this number, the CPU calculates how to display the letter "B" pixel by pixel.
The CPU requests step-by-step instructions from memory, which tell it how to draw the letter "B".
The CPU runs these instructions and stores the results as pixels in memory.

Finally, this pixel information is sent in binary to the screen.
The screen is an output device, which converts the binary signals into the tiny lights and colors that make up what you see.

### How Computers Work: Hardware and Software

A CPU needs to do different things so inside it has smaller, simpler parts that handle specific tasks.
It has circuits to do simple math and logic.
It has other circuits to send and receive information to and from different parts of the computer.

The CPU receives simple commands that tell it which circuit to use to do a specific job.
For example, an "add" command tells the CPU to use its outer circuit to calculate a new number.
And then the "store" command tells the CPU to use a different circuit to save that result into memory.
The binary commands are stored in memory and the CPU fetches and executes them in sequence one after the other.

Software tells the CPU what to do,
but when you're listening to music, and browsing the web, and chatting with a friend,
your computer is running multiple pieces of software all at once.
So, how do all of these programs get on the computer in the first place,
and how can the CPU run them all at once?
To find out we'll have to take a look at the operating system.


> Computers have the potential to do all kinds of amazing things But the only thing that makes the computer smart, or useful, is you.
