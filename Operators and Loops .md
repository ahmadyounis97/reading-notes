   ### LOOP COUNTERS 
    A for loop uses a counter as a condition. This instructs the code to run a specified number of times. Here you can see the condition is made up of three statements:
   ### INITIALIZATION
    Create a variabila nd set it too. This wariable i eommonly collod Land tacts as tha cauntur. var i
    
   ### CONDITION
    is made up condition The loop should cantimus to run until the counter reachesa specified number. i < 10; 
    
   ### UPDATE 
    UPDATE Every tinte the lop has run the statements in the curhy braces, it adds ens to tha coter.
