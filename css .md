### Foreground Color

The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:

* rgb values
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)

*  hex codes 

(These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e8) 

* color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan

### Background Color
CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.
You can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways you can specify
foreground colors: RGB values,
hex codes, and color names
(covered on the next page).

### Understanding Color
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.
Computer monitors are made
up of thousands of tiny squares
called pixels (if you look very
closely at your monitor you
should be able to see them).
When the screen is not turned
on, it's black because it's not
emitting any light. When it's
on, each pixel can be a different
color, creating a picture.

Color picking tools are available
in image editing programs like
Photoshop and GIMP. You can
see the RGB values specified
next to the radio buttons that
say R, G, B.

### Contrast
When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.

>If text is reversed out (a light color on a dark background), you
can increase the height between lines and the weight of the font
to make it easier to read.

##CSS3: HSL Colors
CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive
way to specify colors using hue, saturation,
and lightness values.

* HUE
Hue is the colloquial idea of
color. In HSL colors, hue is often
represented as a color circle
where the angle represents the
color, although it may also be
shown as a slider with values
from 0 to 360.

* saturation
Saturation is the amount of
gray in a color. Saturation is
represented as a percentage.
100% is full saturation and 0%
is a shade of gray.

* lightness
Lightness is the amount of
white (lightness) or black
(darkness) in a color. Lightness
is represented as a percentage.
0% lightness is black, 100%
lightness is white, and 50%
lightness is normal. Lightness
is sometimes referred to as
luminosity

>alpha
This is expressed as a
number between 0 and 1.0.
For example, 0.5 represents
50% transparency, and 0.75
represents 75% transparency.
