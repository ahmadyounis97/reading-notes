## WRITING A SCRIPT
To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed inorder to achieve it.

Humans can achieve complex goals without thinking
about them too much, for example you might be
able to drive a car, cook breakfast, or send an email
without a set of detailed instructions. But the first
time we do these things they can seem daunting.
Therefore, when learning a new skill, we often break
it down into smaller tasks, and learn one of these at
a time. With experience these individual tasks grow
familiar and seem simpler. 

Some of the scripts you will be reading or writing
when you have finished this book will be quite
complicated and might look intimidating at
first. However, a script is just a series of short
instructions, each of which is performed in order
to solve the problem in hand. This is why creating a
script is like writing a recipe or manual that allows a
computer to solve a puzzle one step at a time.

## What is a script and how do I create one ? 

1. A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.

2. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.

3. Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically. 

## EXPRESSIONS 
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions. 

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE
In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be
given a value. As you have seen, this is done using
the assignment operator (the equals sign).
( var color = 'beige'; )
The value of co 1 or is now beige.

2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE
You can perform operations on any number of
individual values (see next page) to determine a
single value. For example:
var area = 3 * 2;
The value of area is now 6. 

## OPERATORS 
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values. 

## ARITHMETI C OPERATORS 
JavaScript contains the following mathematical
operators, which you can use with numbers.
You may remember some from math class. 

| NAME  | OPERATOR  |  PURPOSE & NOTES | EXAMPLE  | RESULT  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ADDITION  | +  |  Adds one value to another |  10 + 5 |  15 |
| MODULUS   | %  | Divides two values and returns the remainder  | 10 % 3  |  1  |
